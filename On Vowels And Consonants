On Vowels And Consonants
Johan Thornton just now

Alright you can howl on these verses undressed;
A tight set of vowels; together expressed
To a slight-ish endower of terse exploitation
Of mightyful powerful verse exploration.

While consonants fit for a bit, some with sibilance;
They alliterate; and vowels have assonance imminence!
Give grammar ambivalence the dropped connotations
So earlier rhyme-backs fulfill expectations.
